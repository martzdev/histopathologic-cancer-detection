# Histopathologic cancer detection
Identifying metastatic cancer using machine learning

## This time we go full medical
- Our task: find malign tumor tissues in *a lot* of images
- Approach: 
  - Create a neural network model (obviously)
  - Try different 'cells' to get peak performance from it
  
### Data

#### In this example you can easily 'predict' the malign one.
